            <p>Welcome to my <strong>Home Course Page,</strong> I'm Hassan Daniel Fiyinfoluwa from Lagos, Nigeria. 
                I live in a large city where education isn't easy to gain despite the large population. Fortunately, I'm 
                enrolled as an online student in BYU Idaho. Currently studying Computer programming. This is my first Website and
                will be so happy to complete this.
